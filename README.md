This repository contains examples showing how to configure core workspace functionality for your application using our workspace API.

### Workspace Platform

Want to focus on configuring a workspace platform that can utilize all workspace components, apply your branding and launch your applications? This example is a full platform implementation using all the workspace components and applying patterns to the code. For more digestable examples please consider looking at the other samples which focus on individial aspects of the workspace platform.

### Workspace Components

Want to learn about specific workspace components? If you are starting out and want code examples that just exercise the workspace components (so you can use that learning to build your own workspace platform) then the following is a good starting point.

## Other Integrations

OpenFin is a very easy platform to integrate with. If you need to integrate with something that has a REST API, JavaScript API, .NET API or Java API then then you can create your own integration easily. This section will contain examples of custom integrations to give you an idea of what is possible.

## Before you get started

Read more about our [recommended development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment).

OpenFin Workspace is currently **only supported on Windows**.

## Minimum RVM Version

A desktop owner settings file is no longer required to configure OpenFin Workspace. However, there may be settings that a Desktop Owner may wish to configure (such as version) and this requires a minimum version of the OpenFin RVM. To find the version you currently have do the following:

- Go to `%localappdata%/OpenFin` in windows explorer
- Right-click on OpenFinRVM and select _Properties_
- Click on the _Details_ tab and see your version number

Depending on your version the following rules will apply:

| RVM Version         | Supports Custom Workspace Settings | Setting Required          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| v6.0.0.3 & below    | No                                 | N/A                       |
| v6.1.0.1 - v6.3.1.3 | Yes                                | openfinSystemApplications |
| v6.4.1.1 & above    | Yes                                | systemApps                |

### Example Desktop Owner Setting for OpenFinRVM v6.1.0.1 - v6.3.1.3

```json
{
  "desktopSettings": {
    "openfinSystemApplications": {
      "workspace": {
        "version": "13.0.7",
        "customConfig": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Desktop Owner Setting for OpenFinRVM v6.4.1.1 & Above

```json
{
  "desktopSettings": {
    "systemApps": {
      "workspace": {
        "version": "13.0.7",
        "customConfig": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```
