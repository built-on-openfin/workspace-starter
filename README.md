### Examples

  | Example         | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------------------
| [How To Migrate From A Previous Version](./how-to/migrate-from-a-previous-version) | This is more a guide than an example. The guide covers what is the difference between version 1-4 and version 5-6 and points to examples on how to manage those differences.                
| [How To Register With Home](./how-to/register-with-home) | You have a Workspace Platform Application that reads a rest endpoint file (your application may wish to authenticate the user before doing so) and then provides those applications to OpenFin Home using an API.                
| [How To Register With Home - Basic](./how-to/register-with-home-basic) | You have a basic Workspace Platform Application that has a hardcoded list of apps and provides those apps to OpenFin Home using an API. The example app is visible and has 3 buttons to register/deregister against Home, show Home and hide Home.            
| [How To Register With Store](./how-to/register-with-store)   | This example is an extension of the registering with Home example. The main difference is that it is now using config and the list of apps to use our Storefront APIs to configure a store in addition to Home.
| [How To Register With Store - Basic](./how-to/register-with-store-basic)   | This is a basic example where the apps and store configuration is hard-coded. The example app is visible and has 3 buttons to register/deregister the store, show the store and hide the store.
| [How To Integrate With Salesforce](./how-to/integrate-with-salesforce)   | This example demonstrates how to implement Salesforce integration in OpenFin Workspace using our Salesforce integration API, enabling you to browse and search Salesforce data in OpenFin Home.
| [How To Support Context And Intents](./how-to/support-context-and-intents)   | This example is an extension of the register with store example but shows you how to implement intent support in your workspace platform. It includes various examples of sharing context and different ways of raising an intent and passing the context to the intent target.
| [How To Register With Browser](./how-to/register-with-browser)   | This example provides details on how to use OpenFin's Browser component to implement a Workspace Platform. 
| [How To Customize Workspace](./how-to/customize-workspace)   | This example is an extension of the context and intents how to but includes examples on how to: customize the browser (buttons, menus and context menus), have a custom workspace and page saving setup, how you could implement sharing of workspaces and pages and how you can use notifications and custom home search result templates. 
| [How To Add Workspace Native Window Integration](./how-to/workspace-native-window-integration)   | This example shows an example of configuring Home so that it can launch a native application, capture it's location as a workspace and then launch the workspace to launch and restore the position of the native application. 
| [How To Customize Home Templates](./how-to/customize-home-templates)   | This example demonstrates how to customize home result templates. 
| [How To Use Notifications](./how-to/use-notifications)   | This example demonstrates how to create, interact and audit notifications.

## Minimum RVM Version

A desktop owner settings file is no longer required to configure OpenFin Workspace. However, there may be settings that a Desktop Owner may wish to configure (such as version) and this requires a minimum version of the OpenFin RVM. To find the version you currently have do the following:

- Go to *%localappdata%/OpenFin* in windows explorer
- Right-click on OpenFinRVM and select *Properties*
- Click on the *Details* tab and see your version number

Depending on your version the following rules will apply:

| RVM Version         | Supports Custom Workspace Settings | Setting Required          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| v6.0.0.3 & below    |                 No                 | N/A                       |
| v6.1.0.1 - v6.3.1.3 |                 Yes                | openfinSystemApplications |
| v6.4.1.1 & above    |                 Yes                | systemApps                |
