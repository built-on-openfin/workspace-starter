## OpenFin Workspace v19.0.0

The OpenFin Workspace is a full-featured work environment designed to improve the way you get things done. Built on a secure browsing experience powered by Chromium, the core offering includes a smart digital assistant, a powerful web browser built to support modern application workflows out-of-the-box, a store to aid in the discovery of content and a notification system to surface important moments while they're still important.

## What version does this branch cover?

This branch covers version **v19.0.0** of OpenFin Workspace (there are versioned branches for other releases). [Click here to visit the release notes.](https://developer.openfin.co/versions/?product=Workspace#19.0.4)

## Before you get started

Read more about our [recommended development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment).

OpenFin Workspace is currently **only supported on Windows** but this repo can be run on windows or a mac.

We recommend:

- Using [Node.Js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Using [RVM 7+](https://developer.openfin.co/versions/?product=RVM) on Windows (RVM on the Mac will be version 12+) - The RVM should auto update so this applies to environments where a specific RVM version is used.
- Running [OpenFin Health Check](https://cdn.openfin.co/health/deployment/index.html) - Load this page to see if you will be able to install/run OpenFin without issue.
- Installing [OpenFin Process Manager](https://start.openfin.co/pm) - Install the OpenFin process manager application (this will let you debug any issues you might have with running this repo or your changes)
- Cloning this repo using: **git clone https://github.com/built-on-openfin/workspace-starter.git --depth=1** - We have a lot of history and versioned branches but you only need the main branch to get started (it will always reflect the latest stable release).
- Opening the root workspace-starter folder in Visual Studio Code (instead of opening a how-to subfolder directly in Visual Studio Code) - this will give you access to all the samples and intellisense on JSON files when working on manifests or app directories.
- Running **npm install** from the root folder
- Running **npm run build** from the root folder - this will ensure every sample has all of it's dependencies and builds correctly (you can then open a terminal window or two at e.g. how-to/workspace-platform-starter to build that specific sample or run sample specific commands)

## What you can do with this repository

This repository contains examples showing how to configure core workspace functionality for your application using our workspace API.

### Workspace Platform

Want to focus on configuring a workspace platform that can utilize all workspace components, apply your branding and launch your applications? This example is a full platform implementation using all the workspace components and applying patterns to the code. For more digestable examples please consider looking at the other samples which focus on individual aspects of the workspace platform.

| [How To Register With Home - Basic](./how-to/register-with-home-basic)   | You have a basic Workspace Platform Application that has a hardcoded list of apps and provides those apps to OpenFin Home using an API.

## Other Integrations

OpenFin is a very easy platform to integrate with. If you need to integrate with something that has a REST API, JavaScript API, .NET API or Java API then you can create your own integration easily. This section will contain examples of custom integrations to give you an idea of what is possible.
