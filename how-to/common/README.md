# Common Content

This folder contains common assets that apply across projects. If a sample needs them then it will reference them through the /common path. The local server will map that to this folder.

This lets each sample reference the examples they wish to make available without having to list all of them or duplicate the content. Common styling, images and snapshots can also be made available through this folder.

This folder supports building content written in TypeScript but a the majority of the examples are vanilla html, js and css to keep things simple and easy to tweak and refresh.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

If you build and start one of the other samples it will reference this project if needed.
