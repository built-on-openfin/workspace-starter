A web browser allows the launching of links that do not start with http/https if they are supported e.g. mailto: etc. How can this be configured in an OpenFin application?

## Protocol Support

### Security

The first thing to consider is configuring your manifest's security to allow the use of protocols (in html anchor tags, window.open and fin.System.openUrlWithBrowser calls).

See [API Security](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/api-security) on our website.

Security can be configured at 4 levels.

- Desktop Owner Settings (please refer to our website documentation)
- Platform Level (If you want permissions at the view or window level then they must exist at the platform level).
- Window Level
- View Level

### Note about openExternal

There are two ways of launching specific protocol links. Using the OpenFin API and using the webAPIs permission openExternal. It is generally better to have a specific list of protocols that you intentionally wish to support so for the most part we recommend using the **fin.System.openUrlWithBrowser** API to open protocol links and ensure that only the list of supported protocols are launched. openExternal is a way of letting the system handle the protocol request so it is convenient but you are no longer being explicit in what you want to support.

#### Platform Level

You need to set the root permissions if you want them to be available to your platform and child windows/views. Below you can see that the openUrlWithBrowser permission has been enabled and it has been provided a list of protocols that it should support. For links and window.open calls you need to enable the WebAPIs openExternal permission.

```js
"platform": {
    "permissions": {
      "System": {
        "openUrlWithBrowser": {
          "enabled": true,
          "protocols": [
            "mailto",
            "msteams",
            "tel",
            "zoommtg",
            "zoomus",
            "wbx",
            "slack"
          ]
        }
      },
      "webAPIs": [
        "openExternal"
      ]
    }
}
```

#### Window Level

You can either set the window permissions for all windows through Default Window Options or for a specific window through Window Options when you launch it.

##### Default Window Options

```js
"platform": {
    "permissions": {
      "System": {
        "openUrlWithBrowser": {
          "enabled": true,
          "protocols": [
            "mailto",
            "msteams",
            "tel",
            "zoommtg",
            "zoomus",
            "wbx",
            "slack"
          ]
        }
      },
      "webAPIs": [
        "openExternal"
      ]
    },
    "defaultWindowOptions": {
      "permissions": {
        "System": {
          "openUrlWithBrowser": {

            "protocols": [
              "mailto",
              "msteams",
              "tel",
              "zoommtg",
              "zoomus",

              "slack"
            ]
          }
        },
        "webAPIs": [
          "openExternal"
        ]
      }
    }
}
```
