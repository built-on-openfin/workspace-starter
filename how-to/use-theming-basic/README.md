# Use Theming - Basic

OpenFin Workspace allows you to provide a theme to customize your workspace, this example demonstrates the minimum required to achieve this branding.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and do the initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 14.0.18 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example runs a utility [dos.mjs](./scripts/dos.mjs) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```shell
npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```shell
npm run client
```

5. Type any character into the search box to show the default list of Applications.
   You can now use the custom commands e.g. `/price MSFT.

6. If you modify the project and wish to rebuild you can run setup again or the build command below:

```shell
npm run build
```
