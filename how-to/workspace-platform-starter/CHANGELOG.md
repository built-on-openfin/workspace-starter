# Changelog

## v15

- BREAKING CHANGE: BrowserProvider windowOptions. A number of versions ago we indicated that you should use defaultWindowOptions in the BrowserProvider configuration instead of the old windowOptions setting. We have removed the type from the schema and type and we have updated the main manifest to use defaultWindowOptions(like we did in our other examples as seen in settings.json). Please update your manifest/settings (we will maintain support for window options for the browser configuration for this release but then that backwards compatibility will be removed).
- BREAKING CHANGE: `ModuleHelpers launchPage` helper function now takes a pageId (and it has to be a valid pageId) instead of asking modules to get the platform, use the storage apis and then send a page. This reduces code and also ensures that only valid pages are launched.
- BREAKING CHANGE: The theming methods in module helpers have been encapsulated inside a class returned by the `getThemeClient` method, the old methods `getCurrentThemeId`, `getCurrentIconFolder`, `getCurrentPalette`and `getCurrentColorSchemeMode` have been removed but equivalent functions are available by using `getThemeClient`.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Change ModuleHelpers `condition` method has been encapsulated into a `conditionsClient` retrieved using `getConditionsClient`
- BREAKING CHANGE: Integration preferences endpoint payloads now include the platform and metadata properties, the response should include the preference properties in the `payload` object
- Added conditionsClient has `changed` method which can notify the platform a condition has changed, a lifecycle event `condition-changed` will be raised
- Added [Notification Support](./docs/how-to-use-notifications.md) to the platform. You now have a helper getNotificationClient function that returns a notification client to modules and there are rules around whether a module can have this capability and if you wish to isolate notifications between modules.
- Added an example lifecycle module ExampleNotificationService ([see README.md](./client/src/modules/lifecycle/example-notification-service/README.md)) to the modules folder and added it (enabled:false) to the lifecycleProvider section of the main manifest ([manifest.fin.json](./public/manifest.fin.json)).
- Updated the way the [notification.ts](./client/src/framework/workspace/notifications.ts) registers against the workspace notification center (The notification center is no longer automatically started and that now happens upon registration which resulted removing the check to see if the notification center was running before registering).
- Added fdc3 approach to fdc3.open to the interop broker.
- Change: Default fdc3.open approach has moved from opinionated intent based approach to fdc3 standard based approach. platformProvider interop setting now has openOptions where you can specify openStrategy. Set it to 'intent' if you want the opinionated behavior back.
- Added improvements to the Interop Broker to improve support for FDC3 2.0 conformance.
- Window Positioning Strategy - Added additional defensive coding for instances where windows may be opened and closed quickly asynchronously (e.g. during automation testing). This additional defensiveness is for situations where a reference to a window may no longer exist if it was closed before the check for whether the window is showing or what it's current bounds are.
- Window Positioning Strategy - Added the option to turn window positioning strategy completely off if it is not required e.g. automation testing via the disableWindowPositioningStrategy in the browserProvider settings.
- Added favorites support for Workspaces
- Added favorites support for Pages
- Change Favorites icons are theme aware
- Change Favorites menu has option `menuStyle` to switch between `native` and `custom`
- Fixed Pages and Workspace not appearing in home results as soon as they are created
- Fixed Apps template not updating text color on theme-changed
- Added module helpers `launchWorkspace` method
- Added Native popup menus now support separators, icons
- Added Custom popup menus now support separators, disabled, submenu, checkbox, aria labelling and off-screen positioning
- Added Dock re-ordering is now enabled by default (it can be disabled by setting `dockProvider.disableUserRearrangement` to true)
- Added Dock provider entries now require an `id` field so that they can be identified when re-ordering is enabled
- Added Dock supports endpoints for storage of their config `dock-get` and `dock-set`, if you provide your own endpoints you must handle the adding/removing/ordering of buttons based on the available buttons
- Added ability to specify a preference for a custom view or window height and width for an app through a new setting called launchPreference that can be added to an app definition (this metadata could be used for other types of app in the future but right now only views and classic windows are supported).
- Added ability to specify whether the launched view/window should be autoCentered when launched via the launchPreference setting that can be added to an app definition.
- Added ability to specify a custom Platform API window should be used for a view/inline-view instead of the default browser window through the options setting of launchPreference which can be added to an app definition. The ability to support Platform API Windows and Browser windows was added to v15 of the @openfin/workspace-platform package.
- Updated [how-to-define-apps.md](./docs/how-to-define-apps.md), [how-to-define-apps-fdc3-1-2.md](./docs/how-to-define-apps-fdc3-1-2.md) and [how-to-define-apps-fdc3-2-0.md](./docs/how-to-define-apps-fdc3-2-0.md) to reflect the new launchPreference option.
- Change Platform override for `openGlobalContextMenu` can be configured to use the custom popup menus by setting `browserProvider.menuOptions.style.globalMenu` to `native` or `custom`
- Change Platform override for `openViewTabContextMenu` can be configured to use the custom popup menus by setting `browserProvider.menuOptions.style.viewMenu` to `native` or `custom`
- Change Platform override for `openPageTabContextMenu` can be configured to use the custom popup menus by setting `browserProvider.menuOptions.style.pageMenu` to `native` or `custom`
- Updated launchPreferences to provide a wider range of host options for views. Updated example platform api page to read the title from workspace platform title.
- New Feature - Updated the page composite module so that you can enable an [init options](./client/src/modules/composite/pages/init-options.ts) module that lets you launch a specific page using init params. Example fins link: fin://localhost:8080/manifest.fin.json?$$action=show-page&$$payload=eyAicGFnZUlkIjogImIwY2UxNTg3LTM2ZDAtNGRlZC05ZGU3LTlmNmQyYjc1OGYyNyIgfQ== the payload is a base64 encoded string of { "pageId": "the-id-of-the-page" }
- New Feature - Added a new init module example: launch-workspace so that you can enable an [init options](./client/src/modules/init-options/launch-workspace/init-options.ts) module that lets you launch a specific workspace using init params. Example fins link: fin://localhost:8080/manifest.fin.json?$$action=launch-workspace&$$payload=eyAid29ya3NwYWNlSWQiOiAidGhlLWlkLW9mLXRoZS13b3Jrc3BhY2UiIH0= the payload is a base64 encoded string of { "workspaceId": "the-id-of-the-workspace" }
- Added MenusProvider.popupMenuStyle which sets a global style for popup menus which can be inherited by other components, default to `platform`, but can also be `native` or `custom`
- Added ModuleHelpers now contain MenuClient which can be use to show a popup menu or get the global setting for menu style
- Added Workspaces menu in custom menu module, visibility is disabled by default on the dock
- Added platform action `popup-menu` which can be passed menu options in the payload to display a context menu, it then call the platform action for the result.
- Added ModuleHelpers now contain getEndpointClient. This will give module developers access to endpoints so that useful endpoints can be exposed to teams building modules. Whether the endpoint client is made available to a module and which endpoints are accessible is controlled by the platform owner. See [How to define endpoints](./docs/how-to-define-endpoints.md)
- New Feature - The intent picker now tries to appear in the center of the monitor from where the intent was raised (rather than always showing up on the main monitor).
- Fix - Fixed the basic intent picker that wasn't working correctly.
- Added Tray menu can now use the custom popup menus, will use the global popupMenuStyle but can be overridden by the `trayProvider.popupMenuStyle`
- Updated interopbroker to break out some logic into sub classes in a broker folder. Also removed functions that were not being overridden.
- Removed interop related functions from [apps.ts](./client/src/framework/apps.ts) to [app-intent-helper.ts](./client/src/framework/platform/broker/app-intent-helper.ts) as part of the interopbroker tidy.
- Added support for app providers or platform owners to specify their own endpoint to handle the fetching of manifests (when a url is specified as a source for an app's manifest e.g. view options, window options, snapshot etc instead of the inline equivalent). [launch.ts](./client/src/framework/launch.ts) will now check the following when passed a manifest url:
  - Is there a app specific endpoint available? E.g. if a view app has an id of `my-view-app` then we check for `manifest-get-my-view-app`. If the endpoint exists then we will call the request/response function against that endpoint and pass { url: string; appId: string} as the request. If you are using a fetch endpoint type instead of a custom module and the url is not specified we use the passed manifest url.
  - Is there a platform specific endpoint available - `manifest-get` is specified. This gives platform owners the option of providing a hook where they want to manage the fetching of manifests for their platform. If you are using a fetch endpoint type instead of a custom module and the url is not specified we use the passed manifest url.
  - If none of the above endpoints exist we fall back to the default `await fetch(manifestUrl)` behavior.
  - Added example of how to enable/disable console logging of built in interop broker messages to manifests.
  - Added extra check of view/window title when building a list of intent handler instances.
- Encourage the use of the initOptionsProvider for loading content into the platform.
- Change `getPlatform` moved from IntegrationsHelpers to ModulesHelpers
- Change `launchSnapshot` moved from IntegrationsHelpers to ModulesHelpers
- Change `launchView` moved from IntegrationsHelpers to ModulesHelpers
- Added platform override for `applyWorkspace` which triggers the `workspace-changed` lifecycle event
- Added Dock monitors the `conditions-changed` and refreshes its contents if the condition was used
- Added url property to splashScreenProvider so you can provide your own custom location for the html content
- Change splash screen progress updates are sent using channels so they work cross domain
- Update applyWorkspace logic so that you are not prompted on whether you wish to save changes if you have never loaded a workspace (you just started a session), and you have not got any windows open that would be included in a snapshot and would be lost.
- Added a new composite module: default-workspace. This composite module contains menu logic to show a configurable default workspace menu option in browser, an action to react to the menu selection and two lifecycle entries to support capturing the active workspace switch and applying a default workspace on load.
- Updated the composite module: default-workspace. Now the currently selected mode is always disabled in the menu (it was inconsistent before). When Last Active Workspace is selected the linked workspace is no longer disabled (as this would prevent you from setting it as the default workspace unless you reset via None and then selected it). When a workspace is linked to Last Active Workspace the workspace can still be selected (which will turn off Last Active Workspace) and is marked with "[Active Workspace]" (this can be changed via the lastActive.lastActiveWorkspaceLabel setting).
- Enabled endpoints as a valid manifest type in the appProvider.

## v14

- Added customizable splash screen (splashScreenProvider in settings)
- Apps are refreshed based on the cache interval, if they change then the lifecycle event `apps-changed` is fired
- Dock component subscribes to `apps-changed` lifecycle event and updates any dock based on their tagged apps
- LaunchPage helper logic centralized for home, menus, dynamic dock and share
- LaunchPage helper will always activate page if it already exists, unless `createCopyIfExists` is set
- Added dynamic dock menu module which shows pages, this example module demonstrates how to use the `showPopupWindow` API
- Added additional option for integration getSearchEntries `isSuggestion` to notify when the query was from a suggestion
- Composite module for pages the `page-show` action has been removed, as this is now handled by the centralized launchPage logic
- Composite module for pages now sorts the page name in the menu
- BREAKING CHANGE: LaunchPage helper second parameter has changed from bounds to options containing bounds
- Fix If the manifest comes from the same hostname as the provider.html/shell.html (the main entry page for the platform) then it is an acceptable host. If the manifest is coming from a different host then the manifest-hosts.json file needs to include it.
- Fix: Composite Windows Module update. The Show All Windows, Hide All Windows, Hide Other Windows function update. From v32 of the OpenFin runtime the window isShowing() function returns true if it is on a desktop but false if a window is minimized (for consistency with Electron's approach). This means that our check to see if there are windows to minimize or show in the main browser menu and dock window needs to check isShowing() and if it isn't showing it checks the window state to see if it is minimized. Other places where isShowing is used (broker for taking screenshots of a window/view for an intent instance picker) and the platform override for places launched windows work against currently visible windows (so minimized and hidden windows should not be considered).
- Added: OIDC Auth provider example module
- Fixed: Auth modules initialized only if at least one is enabled
- Fixed: When Toolbar buttons in browserProvider are undefined we maintain this state instead of returning empty array, so that default platform buttons are used.
- Added framework support for the concept of favorites. The introduction of a favoriteProvider has been added to the settings which let you specify settings that aid in support of favorites (if not provided it is assumed that favorites is not enabled for the platform). This provider needs 4 endpoints to be defined: favorite-list, favorite-get, favorite-set and favorite-remove. The generated favorite shapes type provides types starting with Endpoint to help build the endpoint module and know the expected shape.
- Added appProviderOptions `cacheRetrievalStrategy`, defaults to `on-demand`
  - `on-demand` validates/updates the cache every time the list of apps is requested (will reduce requests to app endpoints when app is idle)
  - `interval` validates/updates the cache on a timer based on the cache duration (will make more requests to app endpoints)
- Added trayProvider which will show a tray icon, lets you customize the icon, activation button and menu entries
- Added an example endpoint module: favorites-local-storage with a README showing how it can be wired up if you wanted to looking at using he favoriteClient from a module you are building.
- Added apps in Home can now be favorited, you can see all your favorite apps with the `/fav` command
- Added Store also supports the favorites functionality with secondary app buttons, this can be disabled for store by setting `StorefrontProviderOptions.favoritesEnabled` to false
- Added Favorites conditions for `favorites`, `favorites-app`, `favorites-workspace`, `favorites-page`, `favorites-query`
- Added dock buttons now support conditions to determine if they should be shown
- Added example favorites actions module which shows a popup menu
- Fixed checking condition triggered exception when condition did not exist
- Added Module helpers showPopupMenu for common functionality
- Added conditions now support passing `callerType`and `context`
- Added `include-in-snapshot` composite module which has both actions and conditions to display browser toolbar buttons which can control if a window is included in a snapshot, disabled by default
- FUTURE BREAKING CHANGE `apps` and `buttons` in the dock config have been deprecated and replaced with `entries` which can contain the combined data from the old properties, the old properties will be read for now.
- Change Auth `logged-in` and lifecycle `auth-logged-in` events are now passed the logged in user, if you don't want this to be passed set `authProvider.includeLoggedInUserInfo` to false
- Change Lifecycle events can now be lazy subscribed so a late subscriber will get called with the last payload
- Change Auth `logged-in` events can now be lazy subscribed so a late subscriber when you are already logged in will still receive the current user
- Change Splash screen will now not show if `platform.preventQuitOnLastWindowClosed` is not set as closing the splash screen will exit the platform, a warning will be logged in this scenario
- Added extra check of view/window title when building a list of intent handler instances.
- Encourage the use of the initOptionsProvider for loading content into the platform.

## v13.1

- BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the logic that supported saving page window bounds into local storage or a defined endpoint (so if you created custom endpoints for saving this information please note that it is now in the page data). This was used when saving a page or sharing a page. It now uses the new customData property on the PageObject to append windowBounds. We also now capture the page bounds when Save Page AND Save Page As is called.
- Added baseScore to integration modules to help with ordering of results, integration should use this value for the score property of results they return
- Added support for OpenFin Workspace's Microsoft Low Code Integration (see [How To Setup Low Code Integrations](./docs/how-to-setup-low-code-integrations.md))
- Fetch endpoints substitute url params for all http verbs
- Fetch endpoints now support DELETE, PUT and PATCH http verbs
- Page and Workspace storage using custom endpoints now reduces the JSON stored to just the essential data
- Platform Provider has additional `disableStorageMapping` flag which disables the above mapping
- BREAKING CHANGE: Page and Workspace storage now separates the endpoints for getting all the entries `-list` and a single entry `-get`
- Page and Workspace requests now include the platform uuid in the request
- BREAKING CHANGE: Page and Workspace requests now include additional metadata in the request
- BREAKING CHANGE: Local storage endpoint module has been updated to accommodate the above change
- Endpoint fetch requests now add the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers with `application/json`
- Added a common example app - Framed App in [common/views/frame](./public/common/views/frame/README.md). Which gives an example of loading a iframed app as if it was a view and using the sandboxing and API restrictions while showing communication between the view and the frame.

## v13

- Renamed application to Workspace Platform Starter (WPS)
- Enabled strict mode
- Added JSDoc Linting
- App definition instanceMode extension. New options added: "new" (new means a new instance will be created if an intent is raised and the app specified but no instance id even if there are existing instances. The intent picker will also not show instances as the app provider has indicated they want to just launch a new instance).
- If you app meta data indicates it supports the intent "OpenApp" and therefore fdc3.open then a new instance will be created if fdc3.open is called unless your app instance mode is "single". This is regardless of setting "multi" or "new" in instanceMode. If the intent "OpenApp" is called directly (not through fdc3.open) and your instanceMode is "multi" then it will prompt the user (through the intent resolver) to pick an instance or launch a new instance.

## v12.6

- BREAKING CHANGE (unless you update your manifest): Decoupled home from App logic. Home supported searching for apps plus an array of configurable integrations. If you didn't like the implementation with regards to how apps were filtered or searched and rendered then you didn't have a choice. This update means that our app support is now a module that can be configured in the integration provider (to maintain existing behavior or let you plug in your own). If you don't want app support simply don't add our app module or your own. This gives more flexibility.
- Added ability to set more settings for the Home Provider (this aligns with the settings you would specify if doing it through code).
- Added more logging in platform override when it comes to saving, deleting and fetching workspaces and pages and fixed an issue where a lifecycle event wouldn't have fired if you have had custom storage via endpoints.
- Updated workspace and page integration modules to specify the id of the module definition as the providerId to ensure they do not get out of sync (which was a danger if it was hardcoded).
- Added ability to specify defaultWindowOptions (this replaces windowOptions and offers the full workspace options. We have maintained backwards compatibility if you have windowOptions specified.), defaultPageOptions and defaultViewOptions in the browserProvider
- Added option of specifying whether you want the default Global, Page, or View Menu options included when you specify menu options in the browser provider (this is through browserProvider.menuOptions.includeDefaults)
- Added optional function launchApp to the default module helpers so that modules that need to can launch an app that is listed in the directory (this feature allows the launching of apps without enabling the passing of an app Object)
- Added new example init module that supports the launching of an app by id and enabled it in manifest.fin.json and settings.json e.g. launching call-app = fin://localhost:8080/manifest.fin.json?$$action=launch-app&$$payload=eyAiYXBwSWQiOiAiY2FsbC1hcHAiIH0= the payload is a base64 encoded string of an object that specifies appId.
- Removed appAssetTag from appProvider and added support for two more manifest types. appasset - you have defined an app asset in your manifest and the manifest part of the app definition represents the alias. inline-appasset - you put the app asset definition as the manifest instead of putting it into appAssets in your manifest (so that it can be service and user driven). Also added additional error handling and logging to external and inline-external manifest support.
- Added support for two new composite modules: pages and windows. They contain action and menu implementations. The modules have been added to the manifest and settings.json to show how they can be configured. They show up in the main browser menu and two of the window management options are referenced in the dock. The two modules provide the following actions: page-open, page-show, page-delete, window-show-all, window-hide-all, window-hide-others. The workspace platform starter MenuEntry type has been updated to extend the MenuItemTemplate so that icon's can be specified and sub menus can be specified for a menu entry.
- Added default window positioning strategy for browser windows, which cascades them offset from the previous one
- FDC3 v2 packages no longer in beta, updated to 2.0.1
- Classic window apps are now launched via platform.createWindow instead of fin.Window.create. This allows consistent rules by default and takes advantage of our new offset window behavior.
- Updated npm generate-schema command to generate additional schemas for the platform apps array, view manifests, window manifests and snapshots. Updated the vscode settings to support schema mapping for apps.json, \*.apps.fin.json (array of platform apps), \*.view.fin.json (view manifests), \*.window.fin.json (window manifests), \*.snapshot.fin.json (snapshots) and updated the existing json files to follow this naming convention. This will give you helpful intellisense when editing existing json files or creating new ones.

## v12

- Initial update to interop broker to support fdc3 2.0
- Additional intent picker that is the new default that supports instances
- Support for instanceMode in an app definition to say whether the instance picker should present a single app option or show multiple instances via instanceMode: "single" or "multi"
- Updated images for contact related samples and updated them to set page title as context comes in
- Updated call app to support fdc3 2.0 and initially return the passed context as a getResult return object.
- Updated references to tools for fdc3 2.0 help (intent and context).
- Added a bring to front function when intents are fired at a specific view/window
- Add support for indicating an app has a preference for a single instance (for views/window right now) by setting instanceMode: "single" against an app.
- A new layout helper is added to the getting started window and there is a layout entry in the common apps.json as well
- Added default support for fdc3 1.2 and 2.0 app directory structures and added examples into the public folder.
- Added intellisense to the json files for fdc3 1.2 and 2.0 apps
- dropped the fdc3 app module used for mapping as it is now built into workspace-platform-starter
- broke out the fdc3 tools into different json files.
- Updated the broker to return results in expected format based on whether the view is set to fdc3 1.2 or 2.0
- Workspace platform starter supports interop api, fdc3 1.2 and fdc3 2.0 apps and directory structures.
- autostart is available as an app setting. This can be used if you need an application to start straight after the bootstrapping process. This may be a headless window (that might be needed to provide services to views), a native app that works with the platform and should be auto launched or it could be the launching of another OpenFin app that is required. If this applications need to be launched but shouldn't be visible in home, store or dock then set the app private property to true.
- autostart of apps can be disabled at the platform level by setting the autostartApps bootstrap provider setting to false.
- headlessProvider has been removed from customized. This provider allowed the setting of windows that should be launched after the bootstrapping process. It could be used by content providers to have a headless window launched but meant there were two ways of defining
  content provider related apps. This has been removed because now it can be achieved by defining an app entry (e.g. a manifest type of inline-window or window) with private and autostart set to true.
- Support for a new manifest type has been added (after feedback). We now support inline-snapshot as well as snapshot. We already have inline-view, inline-window and inline-external alongside view, window and external so inline-snapshot was the only one missing and people have found it useful and added it themselves. It is now available in customize to remove the need to add it yourself.

## v11

- Added default secondary buttons config for store

## v10

- Added support for new themes format with light and dark schemes
  - toolbar button icons should now use `{theme}` and `{scheme}` substitution in icon url instead of `themes` property
  - dock button icons can also use the `{theme}` and `{scheme}` syntax
  - added `theme-changed` life cycle event
- Added example of using setSearchQuery API for home integration
- Use Notifications now uses Show/Hide APIs instead of toggle
- Shim randomUUID so that it can be used in non secure contexts
- Added ability to restrict who can connect to your broker and the ability to specify how a payload is validated (which endpoint to use). See [how to manage connections to your platform](./docs/how-to-manage-connections-to-your-platform.md).
- Added ability to collect analytic events generated by the workspace and workspace platform through configuration. See [how to configure analytics](./docs/how-to-configure-analytics.md)
- Added example of splitting initial auth into a shell that only has required logic (in case you want access to the main provider bundle limited until authentication has been performed). The fourth manifest provides an example of this.
- Added example of extending the App definition in order to keep compatibility with Workspace components while also proving data specific to a platform implementation. App definition now has an optional private setting. When set to true the app will no longer show up in Home, Store or Dock but can still be launched via fdc3/interop.
- Add source filter to home with Apps, Pages, Workspaces and integration modules
- Added opinionated support for fdc3.open (see [How To Add Open Support To Your App](./docs/how-to-add-open-support-to-your-app.md))
- Updated example auth to give an example of how workspace can present entitled based data by letting you pick from two users and each user has a role (developer or sales) and the developer role has an apps feed that consists of developer related apps and has menu options that help developers (inspect view, window, platform etc) where as the sales role keeps the demo apps but filters out developer related menu options and apps. **npm run secondclient** will run the demo.
- Moved the create app definition action logic from the app definition module (which has been deleted) into a developer action module which also has inspect menu actions.
- Added ability to specify a minimum and/or maximum version for something your platform depends on (see [How To Add Version Support](./docs/how-to-add-versioning-support.md))
- Moved the workspaces home logic into the Workspaces integration provider
- Moved the pages home logic into the Pages integration provider
- Removed `enableWorkspaceIntegration` from `homeProvider`, enable/disable the Workspaces integration instead
- Removed `enablePageIntegration` from `homeProvider`, enable/disable the Pages integration instead
- Added Automation Testing examples
- Added option of modules receiving a getInteropClient function if they are allowed. Added pattern that a module should listen for the after bootstrap lifecycle event before trying to get an interop client. Added an example to the dev module in modules/composite/developer. There is an analytics implementation that publishes events to an interop/fdc3 channel. This is for dev purposes so you can easily listen to a stream of the events and build a UI (it complements the console analytics module we have). It is only enabled in manifest.fin.json.
- Added intent support for manifest type: inline-window and window. These can now be intent targets. Specifying the name of the window means only a single window will be launched as the intent target.
- Only lookup and use intent target if it isn't undefined, null or an empty string
- Added lifecycle events for `workspace-changed` and `page-changed` so the integrations such as workspace and pages can keep in sync with actual data

## v9.2

- Added `dev` npm script which live build and reloads code for workspace-platform-starter sample
- Added `dispatchFocusEvents: true` to Home provider so integrations should handle `result.action.trigger === "user-action"` to activate entries

## v9.1

- Removed `GETALL` from endpoints to make it behave more like REST, instead use `GET` without an `id` which returns the whole object, not as an array, but as a keyed object
- Add initOptions lifecycle property which defaults to `after-bootstrap`, but has an alternative value of `after-auth`
- Change - headless windows initialization to be towards the end of the bootstrapper instead of before the platform is initialized (allowing windows to be launched after workspace registration is successful).
- Added - an extra check to the fdc3 1.2 mapper to check to see if tags are passed (not part of the 1.2 spec but if they exist they should be used) and if no tags are passed we then use the manifest type as a tag.

## v9

- Added - Lifecycle modules with standard hooks of `after-bootstrap`, `before-quit`
- Added - Condition modules
- Change - Menu entries use `conditions` to determine visibility
- Change - The `sharing` option has been moved from `bootstrapProvider` to `platformProvider` in `customSettings`
- Change - The `conditions.isAuthenticationEnabled` flag has changed to `conditions: ["authenticated"]`
- Added - The toolbar buttons can be enabled/disabled with conditions
- Change - Code folders have been rationalized into `framework\platform`, `framework\shapes`, `framework\workspace`
- Added - `bootstrapProvider.autoShow` now has `none` option to not launch any of the standard components, can be used if you want to hook the life-cycle event if `after-bootstrap` and show you own view
- Fixed - Menu entry incorrectly positioned elements marked as `before`
- Fixed - Modules with multiple entry points correctly handle separate configurations
- Removed - Browser page bound storage no longer has a fallback if the storage endpoint is not configured
- Fixed - Platform overrides quit behavior if called during a snapshot load
- Change - Authentication example uses RegExp match for `authenticatedUrl` instead of exact match
- Fixed - Authentication example used correct `logoutUrl` when determining if it can call logout
- Change - Example modules reference the types using a local namespace `workspace-platform-starter` instead of relative paths
- Added - `package.json` has additional script command `generate-types` which can be used to generate a folder of TypeScript type definitions `.d.ts` files for the shapes, the types can imported when building modules instead of needing to reference the framework directly
