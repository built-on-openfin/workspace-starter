# Workspace Platform Starter

## Welcome to the Workspace Platform Starter How To

This how to provides an example of a configurable workspace platform. Please use the table of contents to navigate the information related to this how-to and how to configure it.

### Live Launch

Launch pre-configured examples to get an idea of what a customized workspace platform can look like. You can launch both of them if you would like to see OpenFin Workspace's multi platform support.

| Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Concepts

The following section covers some key concepts that are good to know when looking at building a Workspace Platform.

| What Is...                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [Container](./docs/what-is-container.md)                                       | The foundation of OpenFin Workspace. This provides a set of capabilities and APIs that you can use in your Workspace Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Workspace](./docs/what-is-workspace.md)                                       | A collection of UI components built on top of Container available via NPM packages that you can can use in your Workspace Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Workspace Platform](./docs/what-is-workspace-platform.md)                     | This is a configurable and opinionated Workspace Platform that you can use to quickly validate your use of Container and Workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [FDC3](./docs/what-is-fdc3.md)                                                 | FDC3 is a standard that OpenFin contributed to FinOS. It provides a set of well known types for contextual data sharing (e.g. contact, organization, instrument etc) and an approach for triggering workflows through intents.                                                                                                                                                    |
| [Persona - A Platform Provider](./docs/what-is-a-platform-provider.md)         | A platform provider is the team that provides a Workspace Platform to be used internally and/or external so that end users can improve the way they discover and interact with content and workflows.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [Persona - A Content Provider](./docs/what-is-a-content-provider.md)           | A content provider creates html, native or OpenFin applications that are listed, discovered and launched from a Workspace Platform. Html Content Providers can have their content reside in many hosts (a browser, within a Native Application, an OpenFin Container and/or an OpenFin Workspace Platform).                                                                       |
| [Persona - An Apps Provider](./docs/what-is-an-apps-provider.md)               | The applications provided by Content Providers can be sourced directly from a single source or it may come from multiple back-end sources (the Platform provider determines this). The list of applications are used by the Home, Store and Dock Workspace components and provide support for FDC3 Intent workflows.                                                              |
| [Persona - An Integration Provider](./docs/what-is-an-integration-provider.md) | An integration provider builds a JavaScript module that receives queries entered into the OpenFin Workspace Home component and returns a list of results. This can be querying data sources to help in the search for data or a contact as an example. It can also be used to provide short cut commands /x to help with Micro Interactions or launching specific workflows.      |
| [Persona - A Vendor](./docs/how-can-a-vendor-use-workspace.md)                 | How can a Vendor work with workspace? They may have their own workspace platform (e.g. like this) that works standalone or may want to connect to a client platform through our Interop API. They may want to allow clients to connect to them through the Interop API or they may want to provide an SDK through the OpenFin Channel API. Read more to see what the options are. |

The above helps provide information related to what is provided and what persona you may be (you can be more than one).
