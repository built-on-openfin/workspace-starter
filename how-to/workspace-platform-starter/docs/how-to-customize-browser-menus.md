# How To Customize Browser Menus

There are 3 menus that can be configured in the customize example.

The global menu, displayed when clicking the browser top left icon:

![Browser Global Menu](./assets/browser-menu-global.png)

The page menu, displayed when clicking the page tab:

![Browser Page Menu](./assets/browser-menu-page.png)

The view menu, displayed when clicking the view tab:

![Browser View Menu](./assets/browser-menu-view.png)

The customization process for all 3 types of menu follows the same pattern. The entries are configured through the following settings in the manifest.

```json
"browserProvider": {
    ...
    "globalMenu": [
        ...
    ],
    "pageMenu": [
        ...
    ],
    "viewMenu": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Configuring The Menu Entries

There is a standard set of menu entries for each of the menu types. You can add/remove or change all the menu entries.

Each entry must specify `id` to identify the menu entry, `include` which determines if the entry should be displayed, `label` for the text to be displayed for the entry, `data` for the information specific to the menu entry and which action to perform, `position` which can determine where the menu entry should appear in relation to other menu entries. There is optional parameters of `separator` which can add a menu separator adjacent to the new entry and `conditions` which can provide more dynamic logic as to its visibility. The other standard properties used by the menu item template (used by the npm packages) is also available so you can specify a submenu or icon if required.

An example menu entry might look something like:

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "globalMenu": [
        {
            "include": true,
            "label": "Log Out and Quit App",
            "data": {
                "type": "Custom",
                "action": {
                    "id": "logout-and-quit"
                }
            },
            "position": {
                "type": "Quit",
                "operation": "after"
            },
            "separator": "before",
            "conditions": ["authenticated"],
        }
    ]
}
```

The `data.type` field can specify one of the standard built-in menu items, which will trigger the default action associated with that id.

Global menu `NewWindow`, `NewPage`, `SavePage`, `SavePageAs`, `CloseWindow`, `RestoreChanges`, `SaveWorkspace`, `SaveWorkspaceAs`, `RenameWorkspace`, `SwitchWorkspace`, `DeleteWorkspace`, `OpenStorefront`, `Quit`

Page menu `Close`, `Duplicate`, `Rename`, `Save`, `SaveAs`

View menu `NewView`, `DuplicateViews`, `OpenWithDefaultBrowser`, `ReloadViews`, `CloseViews`, `AddToChannel`, `RemoveFromChannel`

Or you can specify `Custom` as the `data.type`, in this case the `data` will also need to contain an `action` with an `id` and `customData` which is passed to the action.

When the custom menu entry is clicked the `id` is used to look up one of the platform actions, and the `customData` is passed to it. For more information on actions see [How To Add Custom Actions For Menus and Buttons](./how-to-add-custom-actions-for-menus-and-buttons.md).

The `position` properties determine where in the menu the item is located. The following operations are possible.

- `start` - Positions as the first menu entry
- `end` - Positions as the last menu entry
- `before` - Positions before the item specified by `type`
- `after` - Positions after the item specified by `type`
- `replaceLabel` - Changes the label of the item specified by `type`
- `delete` - Deletes the item specified by `type`

The `separator` property is optional and can be used to add a menu separator either `before` or `after` the menu entry.

Conditions can be used to provided a more dynamic approach to decide if the menu entry should be visible, the menu is constructed on each click. For more information on conditions see [How to Add Conditions](./how-to-add-conditions.md).

The following example create a menu entry to display the Notification Center with a custom action, it is positioned after the Storefront menu entry.

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "globalMenu": [
        {
            "include": true,
            "label": "Toggle Notification Center",
            "data": {
                "type": "Custom",
                "action": {
                    "id": "notification-toggle"
                }
            },
            "position": {
                "type": "OpenStorefront",
                "operation": "after"
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

## Including or Excluding Default Menu Entries

By default when you specify menus through the browser provider we include the defaults provided by the Workspace Platform version you are using.

If you want to have no menu (i.e. you specify an empty array for globalMenu and say you don't want the defaults) then the menu will not appear in your browser. If you just want the defaults you can not specify globalMenu etc settings and the defaults will apply.

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "menuOptions": {
    "includeDefaults": {
     "globalMenu": false,
     "pageMenu": false,
     "viewMenu": false
    }
   }
}
```
