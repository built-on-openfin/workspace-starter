# How To Add Intent Support To Your App

If you have added a view (url based app) to an app directory/source (see [How To Define Apps](./how-to-define-apps.md)) you may want it to be able to trigger a workflow/intent or to support one.

The first thing your app should do is to highlight that it supports the FDC3 standard by opting into the api through it's settings (this can either be inline e.g. manifestType inline-view or a json file manifestType: view) and can either be 1.2 or 2.0. E.g.:

```json
{
    "url": "https://fdc3.finos.org/toolbox/fdc3-workbench/",
    "fdc3InteropApi": "1.2"
},
```

## Do I Need To Reference An Npm Module

You don't need to reference an npm module for the API as we inject the API into your document. If you want to access the TypeScript types then you can reference the official FinOS types package: [FDC3 Types NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finos/fdc3/)

## How Do I Raise An Intent?

In your app would check for the fdc3 api and then trigger a workflow by raising the intent as follows:

```javascript
// --------------------------------
// Raising Intent code
// --------------------------------
if (window.fdc3 !== undefined) {
  const context = {
    type: 'fdc3.contact',
    name: 'John McHugh',
    id: {
      email: 'john.mchugh@example.com'
    }
  };
  const intent = 'StartCall';
  await fdc3.raiseIntent(intent, context);
}
```

## How do I Listen for Intents?

```javascript
// --------------------------------
// Listening code
// --------------------------------
if (window.fdc3 !== undefined) {
  const intent = 'StartCall';
  fdc3.addIntentListener(intent, (ctx) => {
    console.log('Received Context For Intent: ' + intent, ctx);
  });
}
```

## How Do I Raise An Intent By Context?

If you have a contextual object and you just want to raise the dialog to empower the user to make a decision on what supported workflow they want to action then you can do the following:

```javascript
// --------------------------------
// Raising Intent code
// --------------------------------
if (window.fdc3 !== undefined) {
  const context = {
    type: 'fdc3.contact',
    name: 'John McHugh',
    id: {
      email: 'john.mchugh@example.com'
    }
  };
  await fdc3.raiseIntentForContext(context);
}
```

## How Do I Listen For Intents Triggered By raiseIntentForContext?

The code is the same as listening for intents triggered by raiseIntent as it ends up resolving to a selected intent.

```javascript
// --------------------------------
// Listening code
// --------------------------------
if (window.fdc3 !== undefined) {
  const intent = 'StartCall';
  fdc3.addIntentListener(intent, (ctx) => {
    console.log('Received Context For Intent: ' + intent, ctx);
  });
}
```

## How Do I Flag What Intents My App Supports?

This would be done in your app definition. See [how to define an app](./how-to-define-apps.md). An app definition supports an array of intents and our App Definition Builder helps you select from the official list of intents when defining your app.

## Context Objects Passed/Received from an Intent

You can see a list of FDC3 Context Object Definitions here: [FDC3 Context](https://fdc3.finos.org/docs/context/ref/Context).

## Custom Context Objects

If the types listed do not fit your needs the spec was built with extension in mind. You can create your own object types. Remember that you have to specify a type property and the suggestion is to use your organization as part of the namespace in order to avoid conflicts. E.g.

```json
{
  "type": "org.dayofinterest",
  "id": {
    "date": "2024/12/24"
  }
}
```

## What if more than one app can raise the intent but not provide all the required information?

As a platform you can take advantage of having your own interop broker. You can update your intent implementation to enrich a context object before it is sent to the target app.

If you are a platform owner with a variable number of apps from different content providers then you can come up with a pattern where you can dynamically add logic for specific types of context object that could be owned by yourself or one of the teams within your organization.

We have an example of what this could be like in workspace platform starter. You can define endpoints ([See how to define endpoints](./how-to-define-endpoints.md)) that support a requestResponse function where the context will be passed to the function, enriched and then returned. This could be a single JavaScript module for one or more context types or you might have teams that build and own their own JavaScript module for their specific context types. This will let your platform scale without requiring direct changes to your broker's setContext function.

## Test Harnesses

It is useful to be able to test your app against something. When you reference the common apps feed in your instance of workspace platform starter you get a number of useful utilities. We provide two entries related to intent raising in FDC3:

### Intents Using FDC3

This app supports FDC3 raiseIntent and raiseIntentByContext, it lists all the supported intent and context types and generates a code preview for you to copy or simply test against. We provide a similar tool for our Interop API which is compatible with the FDC3 API as well:

![Intents Using FDC3](./assets/view-intents-fdc3.png)

#### Can I use that tool within my own platform?

Yes, to make development easier you can define a view that uses our app. We follow the versioning used by workspace so that you can stay in sync:

##### FDC3 2.0 Tool - View Options

```javascript
{
 "url": "https://samples.openfin.co/dev-extensions/extensions/v19.0.0/interop/fdc3/intent/2-0/fdc3-intent-view.html",
 "fdc3InteropApi": "2.0",
 "customData": {
  "contextData": null,
  "intentData": null
 }
}
```

##### FDC3 1.2 Tool - View Options

```javascript
{
 "url": "https://samples.openfin.co/dev-extensions/extensions/v19.0.0/interop/fdc3/intent/fdc3-intent-view.html",
 "fdc3InteropApi": "1.2",
 "customData": {
  "contextData": null,
  "intentData": null
 }
}
```

### FDC3 Workbench

This is the FinOS test harness to show our compatibility:
