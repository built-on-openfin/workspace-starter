# How To Customize Store

Workspace platform starter has a way of defining your store through configuration (**storefrontProvider**) that can either be inside of your manifest e.g. [manifest.fin.json](../public/manifest.fin.json) or within a JSON response returned by a server e.g. [settings.json](../public/settings.json).

The approach that we have taken is that you define your landing page properties (sections, titles, images) and rather than directly link specific applications you specify tags that will be used to pull in applications for each part of the store. You are then free to tag applications and have them automatically appear in relevant sections of the store.

## Where Does The Search Results In Store Come From?

It comes from the list of all the [apps](./how-to-define-apps.md) that the user is [entitled](./how-to-apply-entitlements.md) to.

## Anything Else?

The [manifest.fin.json](../public/manifest.fin.json)/[settings.json](../public/settings.json) configuration for the storefront does not include an `id` for the `cta`, `items` and `navigation` sections.

This is to reduce noise in the example manifest and to prevent issues if an item or section is copied and pasted. The code has a fallback that uses the title or title plus tags to form an `id`. This works for the demo, as the manifest file is storing the configuration. If the configuration were ever fetched from a server, then it should return a unique (e.g., GUID) and idempotent ID.

This is because the `id` represents the route that the user navigates to. So, if an `id` for a navigation item was "x" and the user clicked on the link, then the store would call the `getNavigation()` or `getLandingPage()` function and look for a matching `id` of "x". If you regenerate the `id` for a navigation item, e.g., it becomes "y", then the store would not be able to render your page, as there are no items with the `id` of "x".
