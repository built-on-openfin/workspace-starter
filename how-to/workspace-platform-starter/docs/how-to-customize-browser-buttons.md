# How To Customize Browser Buttons

The toolbar buttons on the browser window can be configured in the customize example.

![Browser Toolbar Buttons](./assets/browser-buttons.png)

The list of buttons to display is configured in the manifest as an array.

For each button you must specify an `id`, a flag `include` which determines if it should be shown and the `button` definition. The iconUrl can use the `{theme}` and `{scheme}` placeholders which will get substituted with the current theme id (use the label if not supplied) and light/dark depending on the chosen options. The optional property of `conditions` which also determines if the button should be shown based on additional logic.

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "toolbarButtons": [
        {
            "include": true,
            "id": "home-show",
            "button": {
                "type": "Custom",
                "tooltip": "Show Home",
                "iconUrl": "http://localhost:8080/common/icons/{theme}/{scheme}/search.svg",
                "action": {
                    "id": "home-show",
                    "customData": {}
                }
            },
            "conditions": [
                "authenticated"
            ]
        }
    }]
}
```

The `themes` icons act as an override to the default `iconUrl` in the button definition. The keys used in the `themes` should match the `label` of the configured themes, see [How to Theme Your Platform](./how-to-theme-your-platform.md).

For more information on conditions see [How to Add Conditions](./how-to-add-conditions.md).

## Button Definition

The button definitions can specify one of the built-in button types or a custom button.

The built-in types are one of the following:

- ShowHideTabs
- ColorLinking
- PresetLayouts
- LockUnlockPage
- SaveMenu
- SavePage

They can be used without any additional configuration as follows:

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "toolbarButtons": [
        {
            "include": true,
            "id": "save-menu",
            "button": {
                "type": "SaveMenu"
            }
        }
    }]
}
```

For a custom button you need to define additional data for the button, the `iconUrl` to display an image on the button, the `tooltip` to display when hovering over the button and an `action` which contains both an `id` and optional `customData` to pass to the action.

When the custom button is clicked the `id` is used to look up one of the platform actions, and the `customData` is passed to it. For more information on actions see [How To Add Custom Actions For Menus and Buttons](./how-to-add-custom-actions-for-menus-and-buttons.md).

```json
"browserProvider": {
    "toolbarButtons": [
        {
            "include": true,
            "id": "my-operation-button",
            "button": {
                "type": "Custom",
                "tooltip": "My Operation",
                "iconUrl": "http://localhost:8080/common/icons/{theme}/{scheme}/my-operation.svg",
                "action": {
                    "id": "my-operation",
                    "customData": {
                        "foo": true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }]
}
```
