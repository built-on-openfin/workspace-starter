## Glossary of Terms

This section contains a list of common terms you may read/hear about when talking about OpenFin related solutions. The goal of this page is to provide a brief explanation of each of these terms.

| Term                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform/Workspace Platform/Host | An OpenFin application that generally has an entry point "provider.html" that is initially launched and authenticates the user, goes through a bootstrapping process and shows the initial UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Content Provider/App             | This can be an app defined in an application directory or just a url. Content providers do not share platform concerns and they focus on producing responsive content that can use messaging apis (like FDC3) to share contextual information and support workflows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| View                             | Conceptually similar to iframes but with much more power. A view exists in a layout and loads a url. [See developer docs](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/parts-of-windows-in-browser#view).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Platform Window                  | A window that supports loading views in a layout. It has a basic default template that can be replaced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Browser Window                   | A window that supports loading one or more pages that can have one or more views in a layout. Browser supports theming and provides a toolbar and menus that can be configured. [See developer docs](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/parts-of-windows-in-browser#window).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Page                             | Browser windows support pages. A page contains a layout which can have one or more views. A page can be saved and launched or shared. [See developer docs](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/parts-of-windows-in-browser#page).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Classic Window                   | A window that loads a target url (it can show or hide the native frame) and nothing else. Useful for modals, popup windows etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Snapshot                         | A JSON representation of one of more windows (and the pages/views within them) that can be saved and launched. Snapshots can be layered on top of one another (it doesn't have to replace existing windows).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Workspace                        | A JSON representation of one of more windows (and the pages/views within them) that can be saved and launched. Workspaces can be saved, launched and shared. A workspace represents all the windows currently loaded and displayed. You cannot layer workspaces on top of each other. Workspaces are part of the OpenFin Workspace Platform and build on top of snapshots. There are methods that can be overridden to determine where workspaces (and pages) are saved. Workspace Platform Starter includes a pattern for configuring this through a manifest or a settings service. |
