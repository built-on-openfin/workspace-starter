# Register With Dock Basic

OpenFin Workspace empowers you to take advantage of our dock component by using our Workspace Platform SDK to control the behavior of the OpenFin Dock independent of the Home and Storefront components. This example shows how to do a few basic things such as:

1. Register a dock for your platform.
2. Customize the buttons on the dock.
3. Show/Minimize the dock.

This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

## Running the Sample

To run this sample you can:

- Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.
- Launch the Github hosted version of this sample to interact with it by going to the following link: [Github Workspace Starter Register With Dock Basic](https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv19.0.0%2Fregister-with-dock-basic%2Fmanifest.fin.json)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and do the initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 18.0.0 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example runs a utility [dos.mjs](./scripts/dos.mjs) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```shell
npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```shell
npm run client
```

5. Build the project if you modify the code.

```shell
npm run build
```

### Note About The App

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**. Otherwise you can use Process Manager (which is included in your list of apps).

### How this example works

```shell
npm run client
```

1. When the app first launches you should see the following window:

![Initial window launch](./assets/dock-initial-launch.jpg)

2. Click `Register A Dock Provider` to register the basic settings for a dock.

3. Click `Show Dock` to display the dock which should look as follows:

![Dock view](./assets/dock-view.jpg)

4. You can then interact with the dock which will launch the custom commands registered with the Workplace platform.

5. Use `Minimize Dock` to minimize the dock.

### Note About This Example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!
