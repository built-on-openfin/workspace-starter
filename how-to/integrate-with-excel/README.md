>**_:information_source: OpenFin Workspace:_** [OpenFin Workspace](https://www.openfin.co/workspace/) is a commercial product and this repo is for evaluation purposes (See [LICENSE.MD](LICENSE.MD)). Use of the OpenFin Container and OpenFin Workspace components is only granted pursuant to a  license from OpenFin (see [manifest](public/manifest.fin.json)). Please [**contact us**](https://www.openfin.co/workspace/poc/) if you would like to request a developer evaluation key or to discuss a production license.
OpenFin Workspace is currently **only supported on Windows** although you can run the sample on a Mac for development purposes.

# Integrate with Excel

This example demonstrates handling Excel from a background provider which acts as a bridge to communicate the data to other components.

This application you are about to install is a simple example of plugging in your own content or app. This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

**Running the Sample**

To run this sample you can:

* Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.
* Launch the Github hosted version of this sample to interact with it by going to the following link: <a href="https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv8.0.0%2Fintegrate-with-excel%2Fmanifest.fin.json" target="_blank">Github Workspace Starter Integrate with Excel</a>

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and build the project. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 8.0.0 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example runs a utility [desktop-owner-settings.bat](../common/desktop-owner-settings.bat) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner 
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

  
   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```bash
$ npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```bash
$ start npm run start
```

4. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```bash
$ npm run client
```

5. You can use the custom command in the search box `/excel` which will provide a list of workbooks that can be opened. Follow the instructions in the workbooks to see their functionality in action.

6. If you change the code and wish to build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```
---
**NOTE ABOUT THE APP**

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**.

### How this example works

This example uses context to communicate the data from the Excel workbooks to any other components listening for the FDC3 messages.

Just enter `/excel` to get a list of available workbooks.

### A note about this example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!
