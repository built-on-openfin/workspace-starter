OpenFin Workspace is currently **only supported on Windows** although you can run the sample on a Mac for development purposes.

# Customize Home Templates

OpenFin Workspace empowers you to feed content & apps to OpenFin Home via our API. This gives you the choice of fetching your list of applications from a *Content Discovery Service* or somewhere else.

This application you are about to install is a simple example of plugging in your own content or app. This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

---
**Running the Sample**

To run this sample you can:

* Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.
* Launch the Github hosted version of this sample to interact with it by going to the following link: <a href="https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv6.0.0%2Fcustomize-home-templates%2Fmanifest.fin.json" target="_blank">Github Workspace Starter Customize Home Templates</a>

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

3. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 6.0.0) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example includes a utility (`desktop-owner-settings.bat`) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner 
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

  
   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```bash
$ npm run dos
```

4. Start the test server in a new window.

```bash
$ start npm run start
```

5. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```bash
$ npm run client
```

6. Type any character into the search box to show the default list of Applications.
   You can now use the custom commands e.g. `/price MSFT.


---
**NOTE ABOUT THE APP**

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**. Otherwise you can use Process Manager (which is included in your list of apps).

---
## How it works

The Server in this example provides two sets of content over HTTP GET.

- [A Desktop Owner Settings file to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace (Optional)](public/dos.json)
- [A list of applications](public/apps.json)
- Examples of View and Snapshot Manifest Types

### List of Applications

The [list of applications](public/apps.json) contains a number of examples:

* Load views into OpenFin Browser
* Launch an OpenFin Application using it's manifest file
* Launch a native application
* Launch a page using the snapshot manifest type

These applications are read and transformed in order to be sent to our API.

### How this example works

This example is an extension of the [Register With Home](../register-with-home/) example, for full details on how registering with home works you can find more details there.

The additional commands are added through [home.ts](client/src/home.ts) and custom templates for the commands are defined in [templates.ts](client/src/templates.ts).

The commands implemented are:

```shell
/quote <symbol>
/emoji <code>
```

e.g.

```shell
/quote MSFT
/quote APPL
```

![Customize Home Template Quote](customize-home-templates-quote.gif)

e.g.

```shell
/emoji man
/emoji coffee
```

### A note about this example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!
