# Add Searchable Content to Home in OpenFin Workspace

Home uses a **search provider service** configured using the [OpenFin Search API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/search-api) to understand the Apps and content it can interact with.

This micro application is a simple example of plugging your own content or app.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

3. Start the sample application.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

4. Start Home and Browser application. (If it is not running on your machine already)

```bash
$ npm run start:hb
```
