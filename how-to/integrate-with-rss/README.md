# Integrate With RSS Feeds

HERE Core UI can integrate with many data sources, this starter demonstrates monitoring an RSS feed for data, showing notifications when new entries are added or change, and letting you launch entries in Browser windows. You can also search through home for feed entries which match the input query.

## Running the Sample

To run this sample you can:

- Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and do the initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of HERE Core UI to version 23.2.0 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://resources.here.io/docs/core/manage/desktops/dos/).
   This example runs a utility [dos.mjs](./scripts/dos.mjs) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open HERE processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```shell
npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start Your HERE Core UI Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```shell
npm run client
```

5. Type any character into the search box which will search for matching entries in the RSS feed.
   Any matching entries can be viewed. A background process will also monitor the RSS feed for any changes or additions.

6. If you modify the project and wish to rebuild you can run setup again or the build command below:

```shell
npm run build
```

### Note About This Example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure HERE Core UI. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!
