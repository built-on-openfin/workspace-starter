# Workspace Platform Basic

Using a simplified approach to populating a platform this basic example will use the list of application defined in your manifest.fin.json to populate all the Workspace components Home, Store, Dock and Notifications.

This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

## Running the Sample

To run this sample you can:

- Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.
- Launch the Github hosted version of this sample to interact with it by going to the following link: [Github Workspace Starter - Workspace Platform Starter Basic](https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv19.0.0%2Fworkspace-platform-starter-basic%2Fmanifest.fin.json)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and do an initial build. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 18.0.0 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example runs a utility [dos.mjs](./scripts/dos.mjs) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```shell
npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm run start
```

4. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```shell
npm run client
```

5. Type any character into the search box to show the default list of Applications sourced from the manifest.

6. Build the project if you have changed the code.

```shell
npm run build
```

### Note About The App

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**. Otherwise you can use Process Manager (which is included in your list of apps).

## How it works

The Server in this example provides two sets of content over HTTP GET.

- [A Desktop Owner Settings file to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace (Optional)](./public/common/dos.json)
- Examples of View and Snapshot Manifest Types

### How this example works

For a more detailed look at how each component is used please see the individual examples.

- [Register with Home](../register-with-home/)
- [Register with Store](../register-with-store/)
- [Register with Dock](../register-with-dock/)
- [Register with Notifications](../register-with-notifications/)

### Note About This Example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!
