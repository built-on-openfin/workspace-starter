# What is an Apps Provider?

An Apps Provider is one of the personas you and your team may fall under (you can be more than one).

You have seen what a [Content Provider](./what-is-a-content-provider.md) is. They define their content as an App Definition and provide it to the [Platform Provider](./what-is-a-platform-provider.md). In cases where a Platform Provider supports a number of teams and vendors they may wish to enable the importing of multiple App Directories (each controlled by an Apps Provider) so that they do not need to manage the list of applications and can instead import the feeds from various sources.

This is a choice the [Platform Provider](./what-is-a-platform-provider.md) makes but an Apps Provider is simply someone who aggregates and validates a list of App Definitions and makes them available to the [Platform Provider](./what-is-a-platform-provider.md).
