### Concepts

The following section covers some key concepts that are good to know when looking at building a Workspace Platform.

| What Is...                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [Container](./docs/what-is-container.md)                                       | The foundation of OpenFin Workspace. This provides a set of capabilities and APIs that you can use in your Workspace Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [Workspace](./docs/what-is-workspace.md)                                       | A collection of UI components built on top of Container available via NPM packages that you can can use in your Workspace Platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [Customize Workspace](./docs/what-is-customize-workspace.md)                   | This is a configurable and opinionated Workspace Platform that you can use to quickly validate your use of Container and Workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [FDC3](./docs/what-is-fdc3.md)                                                 | FDC3 is a standard that OpenFin contributed to FinOS. It provides a set of well known types for contextual data sharing (e.g. contact, organization, instrument etc) and an approach for triggering workflows through intents.                                                                                                                                               |
| [Persona - A Platform Provider](./docs/what-is-a-platform-provider.md)         | A platform provider is the team that provides a Workspace Platform to be used internally and/or external so that end users can improve the way they discover and interact with content and workflows.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Persona - A Content Provider](./docs/what-is-a-content-provider.md)           | A content provider creates html, native or OpenFin applications that are listed, discovered and launched from a Workspace Platform. Html Content Providers can have their content reside in many hosts (a browser, within a Native Application, an OpenFin Container and/or an OpenFin Workspace Platform).                                                                  |
| [Persona - An Apps Provider](./docs/what-is-an-apps-provider.md)               | The applications provided by Content Providers can be sourced directly from a single source or it may come from multiple back-end sources (the Platform provider determines this). The list of applications are used by the Home, Store and Dock Workspace components and provide support for FDC3 Intent workflows.                                                         |
| [Persona - An Integration Provider](./docs/what-is-an-integration-provider.md) | An integration provider builds a JavaScript module that receives queries entered into the OpenFin Workspace Home component and returns a list of results. This can be querying data sources to help in the search for data or a contact as an example. It can also be used to provide short cut commands /x to help with Micro Interactions or launching specific workflows. |

The above helps provide information related to what is provided and what persona you may be (you can be more than one).
