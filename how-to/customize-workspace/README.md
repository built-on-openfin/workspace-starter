# Customize Workspace

This sample is an extension of the support context and intents example. The sample covers:

- Registering with Home - with examples of using custom templates with search results.
- Registering a Store
- Customizing OpenFin Browser - Custom main menu, page right click context menu and view right click context menu. This example also shows how to determine what buttons should show in the top right of the menu header and adds a few custom buttons to demonstrate this.
- Supporting Interop/FDC3 Context messages
- Supporting Interop/FDC3 Intents
- Using a golden data source (in [apps.json](../common/public/apps.json)) to drive the apps that show up in Home, Store and in intent resolution
- Customization through config (in the [manifest.fin.json](public/manifest.fin.json) file)
- Workspace saving has been added
- An example of implementing your own sharing function has also been added.
- An example of supporting additional search providers (we include optional support from the integrate-with-salesforce starter project).
- An example of swapping out where workspaces and pages are stored (First Starter uses the default storage and Second Starter enables custom storage).
- An example of having client side authentication. We dynamically load an auth module (which you can swap out with your own) that has a basic implementation so that you can try different states and change how the platform should respond.

This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

## Running the Sample

To run this sample you can:

- Clone this repo and follow the instructions below. This will let you customize the sample to learn more about our APIs.
- Launch the Github hosted version of this sample to interact with it by going to the following link: [Github Workspace Starter Customize Workspace Example](https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv9.0.0%2Fcustomize-workspace%2Fmanifest.fin.json)

- Launch the Second Github hosted version of this sample to see how OpenFin Workspace can support multiple workspace platforms with their own branding. This manifest takes advantage of Desktop System Preferences for Light or Dark mode by providing themes that can match that preference (it is picked up and applied on load): [Github Workspace Starter Second Customize Workspace Example](https://start.openfin.co/?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fbuilt-on-openfin.github.io%2Fworkspace-starter%2Fworkspace%2Fv9.0.0%2Fcustomize-workspace%2Fsecond.manifest.fin.json)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies and build the sample. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```shell
npm run setup
```

2. Optional (if you wish to pin the version of OpenFin Workspace to version 9.0.0 and you are on Windows) - Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings). This example runs a utility [desktop-owner-settings.bat](../common/desktop-owner-settings.bat) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **This is not something you should do in production to close apps as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state/perform an action**).

```shell
npm run dos
```

3. Start the test server in a new window.

```shell
npm start
```

5. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```shell
npm run client
```

If you want to see a second workspace platform run alongside the first you can fire up a copy using the following command:

```shell
npm run secondclient
```

This runs the same code with slightly different settings to show a different theme: [second.manifest.fin.json](public/second.manifest.fin.json)

6. Type any character into the search box to show the default list of applications.
   The [apps](../common/public/apps.json) are displayed as described in their respective files. (OpenFin Home does not read this REST endpoint directly. It is read by the Workspace Platform app and passed to Home via our API).

7. To launch your store launch the Home UI and use / to show a list of the available commands and select Store. Storefront will be shown and your store will be listed.
   The [apps](../common/public/apps.json) are displayed as described in their respective files alongside a Storefront configuration setting defined in your [manifest](public/manifest.fin.json).

8. If you modify the project and want to rebuild.

```shell
npm run build
```

## How it works

The Server in this example provides two sets of content over HTTP GET.

- [A Desktop Owner Settings file](../common/public/dos.json)
- [A list of applications](../common/public/apps.json)
- Examples of View and Snapshot Manifest Types

### List of Applications

The [list of applications](../common/public/apps.json) contains a number of examples:

- Load views into OpenFin Browser
- Launch an OpenFin application using its manifest file
- Launch a native application
- Launch a page using the snapshot manifest type
- Launch through an intent: a view (single instance and multi instance) and a page (single instance and multi instance)

These applications are read and transformed in order to be sent to our API.

### Intent Support Information

This Readme contains information similar to the Support Context and Intents readme (as this is an extension). To make the addition of Intent support clearer it has been moved to it's own markdown file: [**IntentSupport.md**](IntentSupport.md).

### Note About The App

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**. Otherwise you can use Process Manager (which is included in your list of apps).

### How this example works

You have your own [Workspace Platform](public/manifest.fin.json) that is defined through a manifest. It is headless and it starts up a [custom platform provider](public/platform/provider.html). It is launched by the following command (step 5 above):

```shell
npm run client
```

The custom platform provider [provider.ts](client/src/provider.ts) imports the [platform.ts](client/src/platform.ts) and initializes the platform.

The [platform.ts](client/src/platform.ts) initializes the workspace platform by using the init function from [@openfin/workspace-platform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace-platform). This function lets us specify default window options for OpenFin Browser based windows. This lets us specify the icons, title and theme for the Browser Windows. It also defines how the interop broker should work using [interopbroker.ts](client/src/interopbroker.ts).

Once initialized the bootstrapper (that was also imported) is called [bootstrapper](client/src/bootstrapper.ts).

The bootstrapper has the following responsibilities:

1. Import [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to see what should be bootstrapped. (That is, should it setup Store and Home?)
2. Import [home.ts](client/src/home.ts) and ensure that a home provider is registered against home in order to provide a list of applications (if enabled).
3. Import [store.ts](client/src/store.ts) and ensure that a store provider is registered if store is enabled.
4. Import [notifications.ts](client/src/notifications.ts) and ensure that you have registered your platform against notification center if enabled.
5. Import [share.ts](client/src/share.ts) to enable custom share support.
6. Listen for when your workspace platform is about to close and deregister from home, store and notification center.

The **home provider**([home.ts](client/src/home.ts)) imports the following:

- [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) to have access to the relevant functions
- [OpenFin's Workspace Platform NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace-platform) to have access to the right types
- [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to read settings (such as the id, title of the provider and where it should get the list of apps from)
- [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to fetch a list of applications (the home provider maps these into CLI Search Results)
- [browser.ts](client/src/browser.ts) to fetch saved pages and display them in the Home UI and launch/delete them when the action is executed.
- [workspace.ts](client/src/workspace.ts) to fetch saved workspaces and display them in the Home UI and launch/delete them when the action is executed.
- [template.ts](client/src/template.ts) Workspace 6 supports custom templates for search results. This file exports a template for custom saved workspaces and pages.
- [share.ts](client/src/share.ts) The custom template supports custom buttons and we have a share button when it comes to saved pages and workspaces.
- [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the entry the user selects from OpenFin Home

The registration of a provider against home will look like the following:

```javascript
const cliProvider: CLIProvider = {
  title: settings.homeProvider.title,
  id: settings.homeProvider.id,
  icon: settings.homeProvider.icon,
  onUserInput: onUserInput,
  onResultDispatch: onSelection
};

await Home.register(cliProvider);
```

The **store provider**([store.ts](client/src/store.ts)) imports the following:

- [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) to have access to the relevant functions
- [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to read settings (such as the how to configure the store)
- [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to fetch a list of applications when searching and to provide a filtered set of applications for specific store sections
- [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the entry the user selects from OpenFin Store

The registration of a provider against store will look like the following:

```javascript
const storeProvider = {
  id: settings.storefrontProvider.id,
  title: settings.storefrontProvider.title,
  icon: settings.storefrontProvider.icon,
  getNavigation: getNavigation.bind(this),
  getLandingPage: getLandingPage.bind(this),
  getFooter: getFooter.bind(this),
  getApps,
  launchApp: launch
};

await Storefront.register(storeProvider);
```

The [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) file reads the customSettings section of your [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json). Alternatively the second manifest shows a way of fetching settings from a rest endpoint if you specify an endpoint called 'platform-settings' (see [second.manifest.fin.json](public/second.manifest.fin.json) and [settings.json](public/settings.json)):

### Note About The Manifest

This is a demo application for learning and is not meant for production use. Please use this as a way of seeing how you might approach configuring your store.

The manifest for the storefront does not include an `id` for the `cta`, `items` and `navigation` sections.

This is to reduce noise in the example manifest and to prevent issues if an item or section is copied and pasted. The code has a fallback that uses the title or title plus tags to form an `id`. This works for the demo, as the manifest file is storing the configuration. If the configuration were ever fetched from a server, then it should return a unique (e.g., GUID) and idempotent ID.

This is because the `id` represents the route that the user navigates to. So, if an `id` for a navigation item was "x" and the user clicked on the link, then the store would call the `getNavigation()` or `getLandingPage()` function you defined and look for a matching `id` of "x". If you regenerate the `id` for a navigation item, e.g., it becomes "y", then the store would not be able to render your page, as there are no items with the `id` of "x".

These are settings you can experiment with (e.g., if you already have your own CDS for apps, you can update the URL and restart the Workspace Platform. Your server will need to support CORS).

The home provider checks the [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) file for a list of applications and then it reads the apps directory REST endpoint and returns it. The home provider then maps the apps to an array of SearchResult objects. The apps file checks to see if it has permission to launch external processes or download app assets and filter out entries as appropriate. It logs a warning of the apps filtered out and in a real app you could move this logic to the launch action to then notify the user they can't launch that app on this machine.

When a user selects a result in OpenFin Home, it is returned to the home provider and the home provider uses [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the result.

The [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) file imports [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) and [OpenFin's Workspace Platform NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace-platform). It checks the passed app. If the passed app is a Native Application (manifestType: "external") that requires launch external process permissions then it is up to the **Platform Workspace** to support the permission. They can pass the app to launchApp or call fin.System.launchExternalProcess if they want custom logic. If you don't have the launchExternalProcess permission apps.ts filters unsuitable apps out. For any other type of app/manifestType then the entry is passed to the launchApp function provided by the OpenFin workspace platform module.

The [store.ts](client/src/store.ts) file is driven by the config in the manifest file and takes advantage of the building blocks provided in [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) to build the OpenFin Store. It uses [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to use the same source data as the home provider. This way adding a single entry in the [apps.json](public/apps.json) file (simulating your server) will populate both. We have an array that points to the common [apps.json](../common/public/apps.json)apps.json and a project specific [apps.json](public/apps.json) which is empty and ready for you to add to.

### Note About This Example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!

## FAQ

- The store isn't launching or the store command isn't showing on the home ui?

  - It might be that the config defining the store is invalid. Open up the dev tools for the headless app and check the console log messages.
  - Ensure that the bootstrap section in the customSettings of the manifest has store set to true.

- I am not seeing what I expected?

  - To ensure you are running the right version of this example run the npm run dos command and npm run kill command before running the workspace platform using npm run client (you only need to run the dos command once and it will lock the workspace version for this sample)

- Things have moved/gone?

  - Please check the upgrade guide which covers what has changed between releases: [Migrate from a previous version guide](../migrate-from-a-previous-version)

- How do I know what the settings in the theme settings in the manifest file actually changes?

  - [Workspace Themes Overview](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/workspace-themes-overview)

- How do I demonstrate intent support?
  - Information related to intents has been put into it's own [IntentSupport.md](IntentSupport.md) file
- How do I demonstrate context support?

  - The sample apps listed include a number examples of context sharing. They all share instruments (either using the fdc3 api or the interop api). Some examples are in the [../common/public/views](../common/public/views) folder. In there you will also see two examples of third-party content (google and trading view) that use preload scripts to listen and react to passed instruments. The view manifests for google and trading view also show how you can define a default context group for a view (they are both defaulted to be on the green context group out of the box). An example can be found here [preload-tradingview-view.json](../common/public/views/tradingview/preload-tradingview-view.json)

- Do I always need a view manifest if it just contains a url?

  - You have control of how you launch views, pages, OpenFin applications and native apps. This project has been updated to support a custom manifest type that is called "inline-view". The entry can be seen here: [../common/public/apps.json](../common/public/apps.json). The [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts#L196) file has been updated to check for this specific type and it calls it's own [launchView](client/src/launch.ts#L49) function instead of using the launchApp function from the workspace-platform sdk. This function checks to ensure that the passed app is either a view or an inline view. If it is an inline view it will take the manifest object from the manifest setting in an app definition. If it is a standard view then the manifest setting points to the manifest url and it will fetch it. Since this is an intent and context sample this change also required updating [interopbroker.ts](client/src/interopbroker.ts#L28). We needed to support inline views in case an inline view supports intents (the entry added into apps.json has an intent definition inside of it).
