OpenFin Workspace is currently **only supported on Windows**.

# Add your content to OpenFin Workspace (Storefront, Home and Browser)

OpenFin Workspace empowers you to feed content and apps to OpenFin Home via our API. This gives you the choice of fetching your list of applications from a *Content Discovery Service* or somewhere else. You can re-use this data source to also populate OpenFin Storefront. OpenFin Storefront lets you discover and launch your content.

This application you are about to install is an example of plugging in your own content or app via code and using configuration and rest services to determine the data to show and how it should be structured. This example assumes you have already [set up your development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies. Note that these examples assume you are in the sub-directory for the example.

```bash
$ npm install
```

2. Build the project.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

3. Set Windows registry key for [Desktop Owner Settings](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/desktop-owner-settings).
   This example includes a utility (`desktop-owner-settings.bat`) that adds the Windows registry key for you, pointing to a local desktop owner 
   settings file so you can test these settings. If you already have a desktop owner settings file, this script prompts to overwrite the location. Be sure to capture the existing location so you can update the key when you are done using this example.

   (**WARNING**: This script kills all open OpenFin processes. **Do not do this in production to close apps, as force killing processes could kill an application while it's trying to save state or perform an action**)

```bash
$ npm run dos
```

4. Start the test server in a new window.

```bash
$ start npm run start
```

5. Start Your Workspace Platform (this starts Workspace if it isn't already running).

```bash
$ npm run client
```

6. Type any character into the search box to show the default list of applications.
   The [apps](public/apps.json) are displayed as described in their respective files. (OpenFin Home does not read this REST endpoint directly. It is read by the Workspace Platform app and passed to Home via our API).

![](workspace-cds-via-api.gif)

6. Click the Storefront button on Home to launch the Storefront and see your applications listed.
   The [apps](public/apps.json) are displayed as described in their respective files alongside a Storefront configuration setting defined in your [manifest](public/manifest.fin.json).

## How it works

The Server in this example provides two sets of content over HTTP GET.

- [A Desktop Owner Settings file](public/dos.json)
- [A list of applications](public/apps.json)
- Examples of View and Snapshot Manifest Types

When Home starts, it first looks at the Desktop Owner Settings file, configured in step 3, for a overridden `logo`, and `appDirectoryUrl`.

In this example, the [Desktop Owner Settings file](public/dos.json) has its `appDirectoryUrl` configured to an [empty list of applications](public/empty-apps.json). The reason for this is to avoid loading the default set of OpenFin applications. (In this example, we will be providing the apps through the API).

### List of Applications

The [list of applications](public/apps.json) contains a number of examples:

* Load views into OpenFin Browser
* Launch an OpenFin application using its manifest file
* Launch a native application
* Launch a page using the snapshot manifest type

These applications are read and transformed in order to be sent to our API.

**NOTE ABOUT THE APP**

This is a headless application. If you wish to debug it then you can update the [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json) and set platform.autoShow to **true**. Otherwise you can use Process Manager (which is included in your list of apps).

---
### How this example works

You have your own [Workspace Platform](public/manifest.fin.json) that is defined through a manifest. It is headless and it starts up a [custom platform provider](public/platform/provider.html). It is launched by the following command (step 5 above):

```bash
$ npm run client
```

The custom platform provider [provider.ts](client/src/provider.ts) imports the [platform.ts](client/src/platform.ts) and initializes the platform. Once initialized the bootstrapper (that was also imported) is called [bootstrapper](client/src/bootstrapper.ts). 

The bootstrapper has two main responsibilities:

1. Import [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to see what should be bootstrapped. (That is, should it setup Store and Home?)
3. Import [workspace.ts](client/src/workspace.ts) and ensure that OpenFin Workspace is running.
4. Import [search.ts](client/src/search.ts) and ensure that a search provider is registered against home in order to provide a list of applications (if enabled).
5. Import [store.ts](client/src/store.ts) and ensure that a store provider is registered if store is enabled.

The **search provider**([search.ts](client/src/search.ts)) imports the following:

-  [OpenFin's Search NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/search-api) to have access to the relevant functions
- [workspace.ts](client/src/workspace.ts) for getting the right UUID to register the search provider against
- [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to read settings (such as the name, title and topics to use)
- [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to fetch a list of applications (the search provider maps these into search results
- [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the entry the user selects from OpenFin Home


The **store provider**([store.ts](client/src/store.ts)) imports the following:
- [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) to have access to the relevant functions
- [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) to read settings (such as the how to configure the store)
- [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to fetch a list of applications when searching and to provide a filtered set of applications for specific store sections
- [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the entry the user selects from OpenFin Store

The [settings.ts](client/src/settings.ts) file reads the customSettings section of your [manifest file](public/manifest.fin.json):

**NOTE ABOUT THE MANIFEST**

This is a demo application for learning and is not meant for production use. Please use this as a way of seeing how you might approach configuring your store.

The manifest for the storefront does not include an `id` for the `cta`, `items` and `navigation` sections. 

This is to reduce noise in the example manifest and to prevent issues if an item or section is copied and pasted. The code has a fallback that uses the title or title plus tags to form an `id`. This works for the demo, as the manifest file is storing the configuration. If the configuration were ever fetched from a server, then it should return a unique (e.g., GUID) and idempotent ID. 

This is because the `id` represents the route that the user navigates to. So, if an` id` for a navigation item was "x" and the user clicked on the link, then the store would call the `getNavigation()` or `getLandingPage()` function you defined and look for a matching `id` of "x". If you regenerate the `id` for a navigation item, e.g., it becomes "y", then the store would not be able to render your page, as there are no items with the `id` of "x". 

---


These are settings you can experiment with (e.g., if you already have your own CDS for apps, you can update the URL and restart the Workspace Platform).

The search provider checks the [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) file for a list of applications and then it reads the apps directory REST endpoint and returns it. The search provider then maps the apps to an array of SearchResult objects. The apps file checks to see if it has permission to launch external processes or download app assets and filter out entries as appropriate. It logs a warning of the apps filtered out and in a real app you could move this logic to the launch action to then notify the user they can't launch that app on this machine.

When a user selects a result in OpenFin Home, it is returned to the search provider and the search provider uses [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) to launch the result.

The [launch.ts](client/src/launch.ts) file imports [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace). It checks the passed app. If the passed app is a Native Application (manifestType: "external") that requires launch external process permissions then it is up to the **Platform Workspace** to call fin.System.launchExternalProcess and have the relevant permission (for now apps.ts filters unsuitable apps out). For any other type of app/manifestType then the entry is passed to the launchApp function provided by the OpenFin workspace module.

![](workspace-cds-via-api-launch.gif)

The [store.ts](client/src/store.ts) file is driven by the config in the manifest file and takes advantage of the building blocks provided in [OpenFin's Workspace NPM Module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfin/workspace) to build the OpenFin Store. It uses [apps.ts](client/src/apps.ts) to use the same source data as the search provider. This way adding a single entry in the [apps.json](public/apps.json) file (simulating your server) will populate both.

### A note about this example

This is an example of how to use our APIs to configure OpenFin Workspace. It's purpose is to provide an example and provide suggestions. This is not a production application and shouldn't be treated as such. Please use this as a guide and provide feedback. Thanks!

---
**FAQ**

- The store isn't launching or the store button isn't showing on the home ui?
  
  - ensure that you have run the dos command and killed all OpenFin applications before launching the UI (the flag enabling the store might not be set).
 
   - It might be that the config defining the store is invalid. Open up the dev tools for the headless app and check the console log messages.
   - Ensure that the bootstrap section in the customSettings of the manifest has store set to true.
